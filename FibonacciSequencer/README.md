# Fibonacci Sequencer

This is the combination of abstractions used in making the **Fibonacci Sequencer** with circuit simulation using **Verilog HDL**.

The file contains **FSM code**, which is the main code for the Fibonacci Sequencer FSM (Finite State Machine) and the codes for other corresponding elements.
